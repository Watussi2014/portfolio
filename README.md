# Hey there !
Welcome to my portfolio repository :) 


Inside you'll find some of my data engineering related project that I made during my time @ [Turing College](https://www.turingcollege.com/).

## 1. [Formula 1 Data Pipeline](./dbt/M3S2-Formula1_Data_Pipeline)
In this project I build a data pipeline that will get Formula 1 data, ingest it inside a RDBMS and then transform it using dbt.

Technologies used : 
* Docker
* dbt
* Python
* PostgreSQL

## 2. [Football data pipeline blogpost](Airflow/M3Capstone-Football_data_pipeline)
I have written a blog post about the ETL process and data pipelines. Inside of it I explain how the data moved through the pipeline and explain the import steps along the way.

Technologies used : 
* Docker
* Airflow
* dbt
* Python
* PostgreSQL
